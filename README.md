 # Image Cases Studies
Python prototypes of image processing methods

## Presentation

### Motivation

This collection of scripts is intended to prototype methods and functionalities that
could be useful in [darktable](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable) and
show proofs of concept.

### How it's made

It's written in Python 3, and relies on PIL (Python Image Library) for the I/O, Numpy for the arrays
operations, and Numba to optimize the execution time. Heavy arrays operations 
are parallelized through multiprocesses but can be run serialized as well.


Every function is timed natively, so you can benchmark performance. 

### What's inside

For now, we have :

* Filters :
    * Gaussian blur
    * Bessel blur (Kaiser denoising)
    * bilateral filter
    * unsharp mask
    * Richardson-Lucy blind and non-blind deconvolution with Total Variation regularization
* Windows/Kernels : (*for convolution and frequential analysis*)
    * Poisson/exponential
    * Kaiser-Bessel
    * Gauss
    
A collection of test pictures is in `img` directory and the converted pictures
are in `img` subfolders. The built-in functions are in the `lib.utils` module.
    
### Current prototypes

#### Unsharp mask with bilateral filter

[Unsharp masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking)
is usually performed with a Gaussian blur and results in halos
around the sharp edges of the image.

Using a [bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter) 
(e.g a *surface blur*) on the L channel allows to perform a better unsharp mask without
halos, because we don't sharpen the edges. It's much slower though.
Run or see `bilateral_unsharp_mask.py`.

This 1.7 Mpx picture took around 18s to compute on an Intel i7 2.20 GHz Sandy Bridge with 8 threads. 

#### Defringe with bilateral filter

Purples and green fringes along edges are classic chromatic aberrations caused by lenses that
occur at wide aperture. Defringing is usually performed with edge detection, by desaturing
edges. However, this can lead to legitimate purple edges (lips, signs) becoming muddy grey. 

Using a [bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter) 
(e.g a *surface blur*) on the A channel allows fringe reduction without affecting
the legitimate edges.

This 1.7 Mpx picture took around 13s to compute on an Intel i7 2.20 GHz Sandy Bridge with 8 threads. 

#### Richardson-Lucy deconvolution

In theory, blurred and noisy pictures can be perfectly sharpened if we perfectly 
know the [*Point spread function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function) 
of their maker. In practice, we can only estimate it.
One of the means to do so is the [Richardson-Lucy deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution).

The Richardson-Lucy algorithm used here is  modified to implement [Total Variation regularization
](http://www.cs.sfu.ca/~pingtan/Papers/pami10_deblur.pdf). It can be run in a non-blind fashion (when the PSF is known)
or in a blind one to determine the PSF iteratively from an initial guess.

##### Blurred original :

##### After (fast algorithm - 52 s - 50 iterations - Non blind):
This takes in input an user-defined SPF guessed by trial and error.

##### After (myope algorithm - 238 s - 50 iterations - Semi-Blind refinement):
This takes in input an user-defined SPF guessed by trial and error but will refine it every iteration.

##### After (blind algorithm - 236 s - 50 iterations - Blind):
This takes in input a dumb SPF (ones) and will build the SPF along from scratch. Some parameters are still under developement.

TO DO : compute the blind SPF on a part of the picture only with a mask, then apply the solution


## Installation

It's not recommended to install this *unstable* framework on your Python environnement, but rather to build
its modules and use it from its directory.

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

On Linux systems, if you have Python 2 and 3 interpreters installed together, you may run :

    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

    
## Use

Import the required Python packages : 

```python
from lib import utils # if you are working directly in the package directory
from PIL import Image 
import numpy as np
from skimage import color
```
    
Load an image as a 3D RGBÂ array:

```python
with Image.open("path/image") as pic:

        pic = np.array(pic).astype(float)
```
    
Set/Reset RGB channels 

```python
pic[..., 0] = numpy.array([...]) # sets the R channel with a 2D numpy array
pic[..., 1] = numpy.array([...]) # sets the G channel with a 2D numpy array
pic[..., 2] = numpy.array([...]) # sets the B channel with a 2D numpy array
```
    
    
Blur a channel : 

    i = # 0, 1 or 2
    pic[..., i] = utils.bilateral_filter(pic[..., i], 10, 6.0, 3.0)
    
Save the picture :
    
```python
with Image.fromarray(pic) as output:

    output.save("file.jpg")
```
    
See the scripts in the root directory for real examples.
