 # Image Cases Studies
Python prototypes of image processing methods

## Presentation

### Motivation

This collection of scripts is intended to prototype methods and functionalities that
could be useful in [DarkTable](https://github.com/darktable-org/darktable) and
show proofs of concept.

### How it's made

It's written in Python 3, and relies deeply on PIL (Python Image Library) for the I/O, Numpy for the arrays
operations, and Cython to optimize the execution time. Heavy arrays operations 
are parallelized through multithreading but
can be run serialized as well.

Images are open from 8 bits RGB and stored in a class that keeps LAB and RGB copies,
automatically updating the RGB representation when L, A, or B channels are modified.

Every function is timed natively, so you can benchmark performance. 

The built-in functions are staticly typed and compiled with Cython.

### What's inside

For now, we have :

* Blending modes in LAB:
    * overlay
* Filters in LAB :
    * Gaussian blur
    * Bessel blur (Kaiser denoising)
    * bilateral filter
    * unsharp mask
    
A collection of test pictures is in `img` directory and the converted pictures
are in `img` subfolders.
    
### Current prototypes

#### Unsharp mask with bilateral filter

[Unsharp masking](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Unsharp_masking)
is usually performed with a Gaussian blur and results in halos
around the sharp edges of the image.

Using a [bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter) 
(e.g a *surface blur*) on the L channel allows to perform a better unsharp mask without
halos, because we don't sharpen the edges. It's much slower though.
Run or see `bilateral_unsharp_mask.py`.

This 1.7 Mpx picture took around 18s to compute on an Intel i7 Sandy Bridge with 8 threads. 

#### Defringe with bilateral filter

Purples and green fringes along edges are classic chromatic aberrations caused by lenses that
occur at wide aperture. Defringing is usually performed with edge detection, by desaturing
edges. However, this can lead to legitimate purple edges (lips, signs) becoming muddy grey. 

Using a [bilateral filter](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bilateral_filter) 
(e.g a *surface blur*) on the A channel allows fringe reduction without affecting
the legitimate edges.

This 1.7 Mpx picture took around 13s to compute on an Intel i7 Sandy Bridge with 8 threads. 

## Installation

It's not recommended to install this *unstable* framework on your Python environnement, but rather to build
its modules and use it from its directory.

You need `distutils` and `cython` prior to anything. Then, the following command will
build the C modules and check the dependencies :

    python setup.py build_ext --inplace

On Linux systems, if you have Python 2 and 3 interpreters installed together, you may run :

    python3 setup.py build_ext --inplace

    
## Use

Import PIL and the library : 

    from lib import utils # if you are working directly in the package directory
    from PIL import Image
    
Load an image :

    with Image.open("path/image") as pic:

            pic = utils.image_open(pic)
    
Then, the LAB channels have `numpy.ndarray` types can be accessed and set from properties :

    pic.L = numpy.array([...]) # sets the L channel with a 2D numpy array
    pic.A = numpy.array([...]) # sets the A channel with a 2D numpy array
    pic.B = numpy.array([...]) # sets the B channel with a 2D numpy array
    
    pic.LAB = numpy.array([...]) # sets the LAB channels with a 3D numpy array
    
When you set/reset an LAB channel, the RGB ones are automatically updated. However,
once set with `utils.image_open()`, the RGB channels are read-only. To override them, you need to create a
new instance :

    pic.RGB = numpy.array([...]) # ERROR
    pic = utils.image_open(pic.RGB + 2) # Set/Reset RGBÂ channels
    

Blur the L channel : 

    pic.L = utils.bilateral_filter(pic.L, 10, 6.0, 3.0)
    
Save the picture :
    
    with Image.fromarray(pic.RGB) as output: #Save the RGB channels

                output.save("file.jpg")
    
See the scripts in the root directory for real examples.
