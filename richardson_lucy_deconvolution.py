This script shows an implementation of the Richardson-Lucy deconvolution.

In theory, blurred and noisy pictures can be perfectly sharpened if we perfectly 
know the [*Point spread function*](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Point_spread_function) 
of their maker. In practice, we can only estimate it.
One of the means to do so is the [Richardson-Lucy deconvolution](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Richardson%E2%80%93Lucy_deconvolution).

The Richardson-Lucy algorithm used here has a damping coefficient wich allows to remove from 
the iterations the pixels which deviate to much (x times the standard deviation of the difference
source image - deconvoluted image) from the original image. This pixels are considered 
noise and would be amplificated from iteration to iteration otherwise.
